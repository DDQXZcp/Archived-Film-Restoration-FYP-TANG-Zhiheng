# Advanced Image Processing and Machine-learning Techniques for Film Restoration

FYP Project File by **Dai Xianjie** and **(Herman)TANG Zhiheng**.

Xianjie, I wish you a happy life in Switzerland. It is my pleasure to work with you.

## 1. Hidden Markov Model Method 
### Introduction
Detection and restoration using Hidden Markov Model.

### Idea 
Extract pixel stream from consecutive frames. Analyze the pixel's "abnomality" by Hidden Markov Model. The Model is trained from a set of degraded frames and restored frames. 
### Environment
Jupyter Notebook

## 2. CNN Method
### Introduction
Detection and restoration using Convolutional Neural Network
### Idea 
Apply binary semantic segmentation to a single frame. Reduced network complexity so it can operate in run-time.
### Environment
PyCharm
